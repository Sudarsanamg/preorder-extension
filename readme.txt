2. How it works
When a customer purchases the product with this selling plan, Shopify will collect 30% at checkout and vault the payment method.
After 7 days, you (or your app) are responsible for triggering the charge for the remaining 70%. Shopify stores the payment mandate for this purpose.
3. Charging the Remaining Balance
To collect the remaining payment after 7 days, use the orderCreateMandatePayment mutation. You will need the order ID and the payment mandate information, which you can retrieve from the order's vaultedPaymentMethods field.

Example (simplified):
mutation {
  orderCreateMandatePayment(
    id: "gid://shopify/Order/ORDER_ID"
    idempotencyKey: "YOUR_UNIQUE_KEY"
    amount: {
      amount: "REMAINING_AMOUNT"
      currencyCode: USD
    }
    paymentMandateId: "gid://shopify/PaymentMandate/MANDATE_ID"
  ) {
    payment {
      id
      status
    }
    userErrors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
Replace ORDER_ID, REMAINING_AMOUNT, and MANDATE_ID with the actual values.
4. Notes and Responsibilities
Your app is responsible for scheduling and triggering the remaining payment after 7 days.
Shopify will store the payment method and allow you to charge the remaining balance using the mandate.
You can check the payment terms and status using the PaymentTerms object and the orderPaymentStatus query.
